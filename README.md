HELLO MANILA: a LOVE STORY 

![Hello Manila](http://www.janchristianbernabe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hello_manila.png)

I added two UI components to my Web site. The links on the left sidebar are live, thus are a different color than the other text.  I also created color to the hover, visited, and active elements of the links.

The other UI component is the rendering of the centeral images.  One image is rendered immediately. When a user clicks on it, another image appears (currently there are only two images set).
